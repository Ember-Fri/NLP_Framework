was, in reality proved to be some­ thing of an anticlimax. One distin­ guished theorist at the Metallurgi­ cal Laboratory was so certain of the success of the experiment that he offered not to attend it, although he later relented.
The Hanford plutonium-producing reactors were being designed even before the first chain reaction had been demonstrated: a report by Wigner and his associates (1 ), out­ lining the Hanford design, was is­ sued in January 1943. Construction of the reactors began late that year, and the first one-rated at 250,000 kilowatts-went critical in Septem­ ber 1944.

Following completion of design of the Hanford reactors, the Metallur­ gical Laboratory staff turned its at­ tention to the possibility of using fission energy for generation of elec­ tric power. At the so-called New Piles Seminars, most of the reactor types that later emerged as .power plants were described, at least con­ ceptually: the pressurized water re­ actor, the pebble-bed reactor of Farrington Daniels (which was the forerunner of the present-day high­ temperature gas-cooled reactor), the fast breeder, the aqueous homo­ geneous breeder, heavy water mod­ erator reactors. These various pro­ posals were presented by propo­ nents and were criticized by advo­ cates of other avenues of develop­ ment, as lines already had been drawn among those who preferred different reactor types.
To what extent has nuclear energy followed the paths laid out in those wartime discussions at the Metal­ lurgical Laboratory? What ele­ ments in today's nuclear scene were
________________
Initially, three aims dominated our thinking about nuclear power reac­ tors:
1. Compactness. Since the first power reactors were intended t,o propel a submarine, they had to be compact, which required the use of enriched uranium and either light water moderation or no moderation. The response to the. requirement for a compact energy source was the pressurized water reactor and the beryllium-moderated, oxide-fue1ed, sodium-cooled Submarine Interme­ diate Reactor (SIR) (see Table 1 for reactor abbreviations).
2. Conservation. Because little was known about uranium reserves, much attention was focused, even in the earliest days, on breeder reac­ tors as a means of conserving urani­ um. Indeed, the first reactor to pro­ duce electricity, the Experimental Breeder Reactor I, was a fast breed­ er prototype, and the second, the Homogeneous Reactor Experiment, was a thermal breeder prototype.
3. Cheapness. Since conventional electric energy was generated for


16 American Scientist, Volume 64
less than 5 mills per kilowatt-hour, central nuclear power plants were supposed to produce electricity at this price or less. Cost conscious­ ness led the early designers to focus on systems with intrinsically low fuel-cycle charges-i.e. reactors that used natural uranium and were therefore moderated by either heavy water or graphite.
In the early days at the Chicago Metallurgical Laboratory, nuclear power was conceived primarily in the first two contexts: as a means of propelling a submarine and as a
_ long-term energy source-the breeder. Nuclear energy merely as a short-term  economic  source  of
. power was not viewed at the time as being of central importance, per­ haps because energy from fossil fuel was then so inexpensive in the United States.In the ensuing years, these original logical threads-com­ pactness, conservation, cheapness­ that in the early days seemed dis­ tinct have become interwoven and • indistinct. Perhaps the most sur­ prising development has been the emergence of the light water reactor (LWR) as a dominant type for cen­ tral power, rather than being used simply as•        a        compact source of power. There are throughout the world, operating or being built, more than 200 light water reactors.
That the LWRs have achieved such preeminence as competitive sources of central electricity, despite their use of enriched uranium-and their original invention for a different purpose-is attributable to three factors, aside from the increased cost of fossil-based energy: (1) Naval pressurized water reactors were the only U.S. power reactors available when it was decided to construct a commercial power plant at Shippingport, Pennsylvania. (2) LWRs had proved to be relatively cheap to build. (3) Perhaps most important, the cost of a unit of sep­ arative work had fallen almost threefold between 1945 and 1960. At the time Daniels proposed the pebble-bed pile in 1945, it was ab­ surd to consider burning 235U (ura­ nium-235) costing $35 per gram, but it was not absurd to burn en­ riched uranium in a reactor with low conversion ratio when 235U cost about $12 per gram. Thus, commer­ cial success of the light water reac­ tor reflected the success of the gas-
________________
eoµs diffusion process, as well as the success of oxide fuel that ade high burnup possible. Indeed, in the original metal-fueled reactors, 3,000 megawatt-days per ton (Mwd/t) was a great achievement; today, LWRs with oxide-fuel elements reach 30,000 Mwd/t.
The original belief that only reac­ tors with good fuel economy and natural uranium could be expected to compete commercially was inval­ idated by the success of the diffu­ sion plants and the relatively lower capital costs of the light water sys­ tems as compared with the graphite or the heavy water systems. Yet, the final results are not entirely known. We speak of the maturity of nuclear energy, but commercial fission reac­ tors are not yet old enough for us to determine accurately the relative costs of the different reactor types. The intrinsically lower fuel-cycle cost of the heavy water systems at one time was easily overbalanced by its higher capital cost, except when fixed charges were low. But with all prices escalating so rapidly, it is no longer as clear that LWRs can claim an overall advantage.
The race to commercial power which started in 1945-with high neutron  economy  (heavy  water
· moderated) reactors leading, at least in concept-shifted in the 1960s to LWRs,• and possibly HTGRs, and is still· unfinished: Pickering, a heavy water station in Canada, is enjoying impressive suc­ cess. It is probably a race without a clear-cut winner; the reactor chosen in a given circumstance will depend, in addition to price, on many other factors.
I mention this history to draw a moral: in big reactor-engineering developments, fundamental advan­ tages-at least as perceived a priori-do not necessarily deter­ mine·the ultimate course of events. Developments acquire a force and momentum of their own which can preempt the direction of a technolo­ gy. Newer technologies based on better fundamental principles can be bypassed by the momentum of the older system. The light water reactors were not invented because we believed they would make good central power plants. The momen­ tum of the LWR development and the improvements in gaseous diffu-

sion technology (visualized particu­ larly by Karl Cohen) overcame the basically poor neutron economy of the light water reactors and made them much more attractive as cen­ tral power stations than most would

prototype was built in 1953.
Breeders, fast and
thermal
The distinction between breeder and burner reactors also is being . eroded. I recall listening at the Met­ allurgical Laboratory in 1944 to En­ rico Fermi's fir t description of the fast breeder, when he emphasized the high neutron yield per fission in 239Pu                (plutonium-239), and        for Fermi the breeder meant the fast neutron breeder. Eugene Wigner viewed the matter more broadly; though he and Harry Soo.dak were the first to design a sodium-cooled fast breeder, Wigner also espoused the        Th-233U        (thorium-uranium- 233) thermal ,neutron breeder. Since poisoning, i.e. neutron absorption, by fission products was fatal to the thermal breeder, Wigner proposed the idea (also suggested by Harold Urey) of fluid fuel from which the fission products, and notably 135Xe (xenon-135), could be milked con­ tinuously. Some thought even then was given to the        possibility of breeding, or near breeding, in heter­ ogenedus, heavy water moderated reactors. We spoke of artificial nat­ ural uranium, meaning a one per­ cent mixture of 233U in 232Th, which would barely breed.
As for the light water, closely packed reactors, we knew toward the end of the war that the multipli­ cation constant would approach unity in a natural uranium lattice (because of the high-interaction fast effect), but it seemed unlikely that the conversion ratio in a Th-233U version of such a system could ex­ ceed unity. However, James B. Co­ nant, in a letter to Wigner, raised exactly .this possibility around 1943: he asked whether Germany could build a stockpile of 233U bombs by breeding in the 233U cycle. Our an­ swer was no, but largely because we did not then suspect the neutron yield in the fission of 233U to be ap­ proximately 2.3 :rather than 2.1.
Thirty years later, the fast breeder remains the primary goal of much

The conserva­ tion coefficient of the proposed molten salt thermal breeders can match those of the fast breeders, if the specific inventory can be kept low. It is on this account, among others, that a case can be made for keeping the light of thermal breed­ ing flickering, even though most of the world is committed to the fast breeder.

tor, the uranium requirements {as just defined for breeders) cannot be expressed in terms of a conserva­ tion coefficient, because these reac­ tors cannot create surplus fuel to start up additional reactors. Urani­ um is required-entirely for the LWBR, or  primarily  for the
of our nuclear development but in an embodiment that none in the early days could have conceived: oxide fuel, loose-not close--'-cou­ pling between fuel and chemical recycle, 3 to 5 tonnes of plutonium per 1,000 megawatts electric {Mwe) instead of the 100 or so kilograms specified in the original design.
The ultimate course of the thermal breeder remains uncertain. The Light Water Breeder Reactor (LWBR), which had been dismissed by many because its fuel cycle was too expensive, in today's context of escalating capital costs must be reexamined. And the artificial natu­ ral uranium, heavy water reactors, now emerging as a variant of the CANDO with organic cooling, again must be placed in contention. In the meantime, the fluid-fueled breeders are at the moment considered less seriously than the LWBR. Thus, the thermal breeders, or near breeders, may emerge more as out­ growths of the LWR and CANDO burner reactors than as entirely new engineering concepts such as the fluid-fuel systems. Yet I cannot concede that this trend is necessari­ ly correct. The fuel recycle for het­ erogeneol}s reactors continues to look more and more complex. At the May 1975 Johnson Foundation­ Cornell University Wingspread Conference on Advanced Nuclear Converters and Near Breeders, costs as high as $200/kg-even

as breeders. Those who look upon the breeder primarily as a means of easing the transition to some steady state, no-growth society place much stress on breeding ratio and dou­ bling time (i.e. time to double the original fissile inventory); those who look upon the breeder simply as the energy source needed to maintain our society at a more or less steady state focus more on the economics and reliability of the re­ actor; its doubling time is not of pri­ mary importance as long as the re­ actor is self-sustaining.
We do not know how long the tran­ sition to a steady state will require, and therefore it is impossible to specify what doubling time, or what breeding ratio, will be needed to match the growth of the energy economy. We do know that our cheap uranium resources are limit­ ed; for example, the U.S. resource below $65 per kg is estimated at not more than 3.5 X 106 tonnes. This could support about 1,100 LWRs (with full recycle), 1,700 CANDUs, or 1,400 HTGRs for thirty years at the capacity factors indicated in Table 2 and 1,000-Mwe rating.
The total amount of uranium that must be extracted from the ground to fuel a system based entirely on breeders, if use of nuclear energy grows linearly, is inversely propor­ tional to the conservation coeffi­ cient C: C  (doubling time· X spe-

In both cases, the thirty-year lifetime urani um commitment is approximately 1,500 tonnes of uranium oxide (UaOs) for 1,000 Mwe; and all or most of that commitment must be provided upon start-up of the reac­ tor. Therefore, if the economy ex­ pands fast enough, using these reac­ tors rather than burners does not conserve uranium.
Studies, based on rather high en­ ergy-growth scenarios, suggest that cumulative U.S. uranium require­ ments over the next half century might range from 4,500,000 to 8,000,000 tonnes of U30s, if we should continue to rely on contem­ porary LWRs and low-gain HTGRs. At the end of that period, cumula­ tive consumption might increase by 150,000 to 400,000 tonnes of UaOs each year. In contrast, introduction of the Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor {LMFBR), or its equiva­ lent, during the late 1980s or early 1990s, will cause the cumulative uranium consumption to level off, perhaps between 2,000,000 and 4,000,000 tonnes by the year 2020.
Extensive use of advanced convert­ ers would reduce the rate of deple­ tion of uranium resources. However, if nuclear fission is viewed as a per­ manent means of providing energy,

and not one that will ever be dis­ placed by, say, solar or fusion ener­ gy, then the advanced converters can at best serve to lengthen the ti.me before we deplete our high­ grade uranium deposits. Converters cannot be looked Upon as a means of using the residual uranium in the rocks (perhaps 4 ppm). The net self-energy ratio of a LWR with plutonium recycle-i.e. the energy produced divided by all the energy inputs to bu1ld, operate, and fuel the reactor-is about unity if the original uranium ore concentration is 10 ppm. Even the advanced con­ verters, which might use uranium five times more efficiently (2), would barely show a positive net energy gain if fueled with 4 ppm uramum.
New issues in nuclear

become a standard approach for judging the safety of reactors other than the LWR.
The Rasmussen study has received both criticism and praise: often the criticism stems from those who dis­ like nuclear energy and the praise comes from the nuclear community. Its        critics        notwithstanding, the study has shown the probability of a reactor accident that would cause immense damage to be extremely small. Whether or not one believes that the probability of fatality from 100 LWRs distributed in the Unit­ ed States is precisely one in 5 X 109 per year (as estimated in the Ras- . mussen study), it is hard to imagine the estimate's being 100-fold wrong, and even in that case the risk of harm is much less than the danger imposed by other man-made de­

As I compare the issues we per­ ceived during the infancy of nuclear energy with those that have emerged during its maturity, the public perception and acceptance of nuclear energy appears to be the question that we missed rather badly in the very early days. This issue has emerged as the most criti­ cal question concerning the future of nuclear energy.
What is safe enough? The public perceives a large dam. to be suffi­ ciently safe and hardly gives a sec­ ond thought to questions of dam safety. A sizable fraction of the American public perceives nuclear reactors to be unsafe, even though reactors pose a lower probability of causing harm than do dams.
We  must  concede  that  we  can
energy
On the whole, the early workers in nuclear energy perceived with sur­ prising clarity most of the major issues of nuclear development. We recognized the importance of breed­ ing, of low-cost power, of waste dis­ posal, of the environmental impact of nuclear reactors. Yet, though re­ actor safety was never far from our minds, none of us, with the possible exception of Edward Teller, real­ ized how strongly reactor develop­ ment would depend on the issue of reactor safety. One of my earliest jobs at the Metallurgical Laborato­ ry, in collaboration with Teller, was to estimate the amount of 14C (car­ bon-14) that would be emitted from an air-cooled graphite reactor. Then in 1948, it was Teller who insisted that a special committee on reactor safety be established.
Thirty years later, with the maturi­ ty of nuclear energy, we recognize that these questions of reactor safe­ ty and environmental impact, which, in a sense, were originally perceived, as secondary to the ques­ tion of whether the reactor per­ formed properly and whether it would be economical as compared to fossil fuel, have become domi­ nant. Safety of LWRs has received serious attention in the Rasmussen report (3), a landmark in analysis of the possible hazards of light water reactors. It is probable that this mode of analysis which seeks to as­ sess the probability, as well as the severity, of a reactor accident will

vices.
Reactor safety, ultimately, is char­ acterized by the combination of a very small probability of a serious accident and a large degree of dam­ age. The closest analogy to a reac­ tor, in this respect, is a dam: both produce electricity, and although the probability of accident in either is relatively small, the damage can be very large. More than that, water from a broken dam would inundate land and make it uninhabitable, much as radioactivity from a cata­ strophic reactor accident would in­ terdict land. The two worst dam­ connected disasters in modern his­ tory led to the Johnstown, Pennsyl­ vania, flood in 1889 and the massive slide of Mount Toe into the reser­ voir of the Vajont Dam, near Lon­ garone, Italy, in 1963, forcing a 100-meter high wall of water over the dam (4). About 2,000 persons were killed in each of these dam di­ sasters.


The probability of failure of a dam in California, largely from earth­ quakes, is perhaps one in 100 to one in 1,000 per year (5); yet residents of California show little reluctance to live downstream from a dam, where the probability of harm is or­ ders of magnitude greater than the probability of harm in. a location near a nuclear reactor. Moreover, the consequences of a dam failure can be much more severe; it is esti­ mated that failure of the Folsom Dam above Sacramento, California, would cause 260,000 deaths.

*         never, for all time, say what is "safe enough." Such questions are judged in particular social, cultural, and economic contexts. In the present situation, with oil in crisis, it seems logical to expect the definition of safe enough to be more liberal than it would be in the absence of such crisis. Countries with vast coal re­ sources can afford the luxury of im­ posing stricter definitions of safe enough than can countries that have no coal. Still the argument about what is safe enough is not so sharply rational. What was safe enough in 1950 is judged by some not to be safe enough in 1975. As deficiencies are discovered, the nu­ clear community is committed to correcting them, to improving the safety of reactors and their subsys­ tems. But this surely does not mean that every new improvement must be backfitted onto every reactor. For example, I continue to advocate nuclear parks as a way of improving the safety of reactors and their sub­ systems (6). This of course does not mean that all reactors that have al­ ready been built must be shut down and rebuilt in nuclear parks, nor does advocacy of nuclear parks imply that the risk, as represented by a few hundred reactors that will operate outside parks for perhaps thirty years, is unacceptable.


The next thirty years
It is dangerous to predict the fu­ ture. (My own predictions of very cheap nuclear power have turned out to be very wrong.) One should


1976 January-February 19
take the precaution of not commit­ ting one's prediction to writing, or of being elderly and in poor health at the time of the prediction. I can­ not claim the latter excuse, and I• obviously ani committing my views to writing; nevertheless, I make the following predictions with respect to energy and nuclear power over the next thirty years.
1. The rate of growth of energy, at least in the United States, and pos­ sibly in the rest of the world, will diminish. The Project Indepen­ dence Report (7) suggests that if oil remains at $11 per barrel, then the rate of growth of energy use in the United States will diminish by 1985 from the present 4.2 percent per year to about 2.9 percent annually. This rate would be further de­ creased if active measures of con­ servation, in addition to the work­ ing of the marketplace, were taken. Nevertheless, I would warn most stringently against those who claim that conservation alone can solve the energy problem; it cannot.
2. Competition between the differ­ ent nonbreeder reactors will have been settled, and each will find its place in an appropriate setting. As for the breeder, I would hope that the competition that gives the world at least seven choices of non­ breeders-two LWRs (pressurized water and boiling water), two heavy water reactors (CANDU and Steam Generating Heavy Water Reactor), and three graphite-moderated reac tors (pressure tube (Hanford N­ type), AGR, and HTGR)-will be extended to breeders and near breeders. Being an optimist, I hope that by the year 2000 the world will have a choice of six breeders and near breeders-LMFBR, GCFBR, MSBR, LWBR, CANDU-Th, and HTGR.
3. I confess to being less optimistic about fusion (not to speak of geo­ thermal and solar energy), but this is undoubtedly a prejudice that can be expected, if not excused, in one who has devoted his career to the development of fission.
4. Disposal of radioactive wastes in geologic formations, particularly in bedded salt, will be judged accept­ able. One important discovery that will help convince those who are ready to listen is the remarkable
________________
finding of the spontaneous chain re­ action that occurred in Oklo, Gabon, some 2 X 109 years ago. The total energy released during the million years the reactor operated was about 100 X 109 kilowatt-hours. Some 4 tonnes of fission products, and perhaps 1 tonne of 239Pu, were produced in a natural environment under circumstances very probably less favorable to sequestering the fission products from the.biosphere than would prevail with disposal in salt. Yet evidence suggests that most of the rare-earth fission prod­ ucts, and the Pu, seem to have re­ mained close to where they were created, though the fission-product gases seem to have escaped (8).


5. I expect the trend toward cluster siting, and especially colocation of fuel fabrication and chemical repro­ cessing plants, to move vigorously. In the United States this trend is reinforced by the study on nuclear centers now being conducted as re­ quired by Title II, Section 207, of the Energy Reorganization Act (9).
Can the people be unscared?
As I look into the future, I expect the nuclear controversy will grow rather than diminish, at least dur­ ing the next few years. I hope that continued successful operation of nuclear power plants, together with the growing shortage of oil, will blunt the attack on nuclear power and that the public soon will recog­ nize nuclear energy as an all-but­ inexhaustible energy source that, when handled properly, is accept­ ably safe. Yet, as U.S. Senator John
0. Pastore has said, "It is easier to scare people than to unscare them." Despite the reassurances that I and other nuclear proponents give, por­ tions of the public remain uncon­ vinced.
That we estimate the actual, as con­ trasted to the potential, hazards of nuclear energy to be no greater than the hazards of other energy-produc­ ing systems-particularly dams­ perhaps is the best way to reassure the public. But there are certain es­ sential elements of nuclear energy that are different and that seem to me to be responsible for the pecu­ liar concern over nuclear energy.
First is the newness of the radiation
________________
hazard. When electricity was first introduced, many people were con­ cerned about the possible danger inherent in that new form of energy: several thousand people die of elec­ trocution each year, yet no one would consider banning electricity. So the newness of the radiation haz­ ard, at a time when the public in general is much more sensitive to the deleterious side effects of tech­ nology, is certainly a factor in the public's concern.
There is perhaps a deeply psycho­ logical aspect to the radiation haz­ ard that magnifies the concern over it. In the long course of human his.: tory, we have come to terms rather well with those natural hazards that threaten human life-floods, pesti­ lence, famine. These are things we are prepared to deal with. In the past hundred years, electricity has become part of our human experi­ ence and an accepted hazard, but radiation, especially with its genetic threat, has not yet gained such ac­ ceptance. I would expect our collec­ tive psychology to come to terms with radiation, just as it has come to terms with electricity: we accept a great benefit along with a certain risk.
Second is the persistence of the ra-· dioactive hazard. Land interdicted by radioactive contamination could be hard to clean up. This aspect of the nuclear hazard has prompted me to urge central siting, insofar as it is possible, so that relatively few areas are placed at risk. Such an op­ tion is hardly available in Europe, however. One possibility in Europe is underground siting, which, pre­ liminary estimates suggest, could reduce the absolute damage in the 10-9 per year very large hypotheti­ cal accident; whether this is worth­ while, considering the extremely small probability of a serious re­ lease of radioactivity, is hardly a matter that can be settled. scientifi­ cally. Again, in making such judg­ ments, one must consider alterna­ tives and alternative risks. I repeat that dam failures can interdict land for a long time, and a dam failure appears to be much more probable than a really serious reactor acci­ dent.
Third is the question of diversion of fissile material, a possibility that some opponents of nuclear technol-

ogy consider to be the strongest objection to nuclear energy. But this is a concern we have lived with since the bomb; it is not a charac­ teristic peculiar to nuclear power plants. We cannot avoid this un­ pleasant fact: when man moved into a new era with the discovery of fis­ sion, he assumed certain risks­ among them, the possibility of clan­ destine manufacture of nuclear bombs-in exchange for a weapon that makes war between the super­ powers all but unthinkable.
The fourth general concern people have about nuclear energy is the meticulous attention to detail, not to say rigid security measures, and social stability that it demands. In this sense, nuclear technology is the most demanding technology. Can our societies, our human institu­ tions, cope with the demands of this technology? Obviously one cannot answer such questions with finality.
I have referred elsewhere to nuclear energy as a "Faustian bargain," whereby in exchange for an inex­ haustible source of energy, society promises to pay meticulous atten­ tion to detail and to maintain a cer­ tain degree of social stability (JO). Some have interpreted this to mean that nuclear energy is devilish, and therefore we should have nothing to do with it. But those who draw such a conclusion forget that Goethe's Faust was redeemed:
Angels (soaring in the higher atmo­ sphere, bearing Faust's immortal part)
'Who e'er aspiring, struggles on, For him there is salvation.'
And if to him Celestial Love
Its favouring grace has given,        ,, The        Blessed        Host  comes  from
Above
And welcomes him to Heaven [11].
In embarking on the nuclear enter­ prise we certainly accept on faith that our human intellect is capable of dealing with this new source of energy. But we have much more than faith. We have acquired wis­ dom about the real technical prob­ lems of reactors, and patiently and seriously have dealt with each of the problems as it has arisen. To re­ ject nuclear energy while invoking such magical talismans as fusion, or solar or geothermal energy, seems
________________
to belie an unwarranted technologi­ cal optimism. Of course we must push on with development of these energy sources. But we must also pursue fission technology responsi­ bly; we must learn from our mis­ takes and, as we learn, redeem our­ selves by wisdom even as Faust re­ deemed his pledge through struggle, wisdom, and faith.
